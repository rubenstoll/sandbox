Vowing to create “the world’s only vertically integrated energy company offering end-to-end clean energy products to our customers,”
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that the electric-vehicle maker plans to acquire SolarCity, the largest U.S. installer of rooftop solar arrays.
Musk is also the chairman and cofounder of SolarCity, and his cousin Lyndon Rive is the company’s CEO.

There are plenty of business and financial reasons to be skeptical of this deal: for one thing, the two companies lost a combined $1.7 billion last year,
losses that are only growing. Many observers believe that Musk’s plan is based more on a desire to shore up SolarCity’s faltering business than any benefits to
shareholders or customers. The solar provider has been hit hard by turmoil in the market for residential solar power, and its shares lost 64 percent of their value in the
11 months before the deal was announced.
